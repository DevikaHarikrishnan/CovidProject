# CovidProject

The all in one COVID-19 is a platform aimed at providing the users with all necessary information regarding the current pandemic. Using the platform, the users will be able to get information about current statistics of cases in the country and worldwide, self-assess themselves and their families. They can find all latest updates about the pandemic from all
over the world. Also, as a part of recreation during lockdown, random facts, lockdown games (Quiz/Riddles, Hangman and tic-tac-toe), and lockdown activities are also included in this. There will be multiple user login/logout facilities with out loss of any data per session. The code is written using C Programming language.
