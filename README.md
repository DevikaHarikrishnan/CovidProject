# CovidProject

The all in one COVID-19 is a program aimed at providing the users with all
necessary information regarding the current pandemic. It is a multifunctional
code. Once complete, the users will be able to get information about current
statistics of cases in the country and worldwide, self-assess themselves and
their families. They can find all latest updates about the pandemic from all
over the world. Also, as a part of recreation during lockdown, random facts,
lockdown games (Quiz/Riddles, Hangman and tic-tac-toe), and lockdown
activities are also included in this. There will be multiple user login/logout
facilities with out loss of any data per session.
The code will be written by including all most all the topics covered in the
CS110 course taken by the team. If any additional topics not included in the
course are employed in the preparation of source code, then they will be
included in the references further into the project.
